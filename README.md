# Concurrency in .NET Code Examples

This repository \[will\] contain .NET Core C# version of examples presented in the excellent book [Concurrency in .NET](https://www.manning.com/books/concurrency-in-dot-net) by Riccardo Terrel.  The .NET Framework samples by Riccardo himself can be accessed at https://github.com/rikace/fConcBook.

## Why?

My first objective is to get the sample codes running on .NET Core. Second, update all benchmarks to use BenchmarkDotNet.  There will be changes in some areas that will divert from the examples in the book.

## What about F#?

I'll gladly take pull requests for samples in F#.
